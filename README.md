## About Actuarius ##
Actuarius is a Markdown Processor written in Scala using parser combinators. 

The project homepage can be found on github: https://github.com/chenkelmann/actuarius

For detailled information, please consult the Actuarius Wiki: https://github.com/chenkelmann/actuarius/wiki 

To browse the scaladoc online, go to: http://doc.henkelmann.eu/actuarius/index.html

To try Actuarius out, you can use the web dingus on my home page: http://henkelmann.eu/projects/actuarius/dingus 
(The web preview is currently broken but will be fixed (hopefully) soon.)

To get Actuarius, you can either check out the source from github, use maven/sbt to add it as a dependency (see below) or download the binary jar, javadoc jar or source jar directly from my maven repo at http://maven.henkelmann.eu/eu/henkelmann/

## License ##
Actuarius is licensed under the 3-clause BSD license. For details see the `LICENSE` file that comes with the source.

## Compatibility ##
Actuarius tries to stay as close to the original Markdown syntax definition as possible. There were however some quirks in the original Markdown I did not like. I wrote Actuarius as a Markdown processor for my homebrew blog engine, so I took the liberty to diverge slightly from the way the original Markdown works. The details are explained [in the respective article in the Actuarius Wiki](https://github.com/chenkelmann/actuarius/wiki/Differences-Between-Actuarius-And-Standard-Markdown)

## Maven ##
The group id is `eu.henkelmann`, the artifact id is `actuarius_[scala-version]`, e.g.`actuarius_2.10.0`. The current stable version is 0.2.6. The current development version is 0.2.7-SNAPSHOT.
Actuarius is available from the [Sonatype OSS repository](https://oss.sonatype.org), so you should not have to add any repository definitions.

Starting with version 0.2.5 there are builds for Scala 2.9.2 and 2.10.0. These versions are also available from maven central.
(How I hate Scala's binary incompatibilitiesâ€¦)

## sbt ##
To add the lib to your project, add the following to your `.sbt` file if you are using scala 2.10.x:

    libraryDependencies += "eu.henkelmann" % "actuarius_2.10.0" % "0.2.6"

or, for 2.9.x compatibility:

    libraryDependencies += "eu.henkelmann" % "actuarius_2.9.2" % "0.2.6"
    
    
Currently, Actuarius itself is built using sbt 0.11.x
